## EagleUp models

EagleUp can be installed using the instructions here: http://eagleup.wordpress.com/installation-and-setup/

To use these models, change the EagleUp models path to be the path to Eagle-Resources\EagleUp-models\. 

Eventually This should include models for all parts in the LGX Eagle library.
