## EagleUp models

EagleUp can be installed using the instructions here: http://eagleup.wordpress.com/installation-and-setup/

To use these models, change the models path to be the path to Eagle-Resources\EagleUp-models\. 

To make the solder mask a snazzy LGX orange, set the solder mask color to custom and 
clik OK, then set the Board color to 0xFF7900 and the Traces color the 0xD26400 
(these values will be saved).

Eventually This should provide models for all parts in the LGX library.
